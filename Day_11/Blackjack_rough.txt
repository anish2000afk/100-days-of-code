Addition to both the decks including display for each deck
Objectives : 
  1. Hit function 
  2. Stand function 

HIT FUNCTION: 
  a)If hit over 21 = > You lose

  b)Hits until a limit i.e> 21
    b.1) Option to HIT OR STAND
      b.1.1) Hit again  = > Run b again (# This is the loop)
  
k First is never going over 21
k Question : Where to put for loop? 
k Yes no ? Yes hit
: Add random card
  Total the cards
  if total exceeds 21 You lose.
  Else ask if user wants another hit.

Problem with for loop (sequence not conditionals)
  Idea : create a for loop or a function 
  First instance of double assignment 
  and print of the lines
  while sum < 21:
    Take yes or no 
    if answer == 'yes'  
      add_to_human_deck()
    else:
      stand()

How to randomize computer to choose b/w hit or pass:
While loop to set sum limit to 21
  random_integer = random.randint(1,2)
    if 1 the append():

Creating a winning function
  post standing phase
    if computer / human deck goes over 21:
      went over 21 
        X loses
    if computer / human deck < 21 : 
      if sum (human) > sum (computer) :
        print(human wins)
      else:
        print(human loses)


Creating an over 21 function 
  First sum < 21 : 
    Case 1 : sum_human > 21
      Breaks and runs the sum_computer; 
      computer_sum > 21;
      Is ace going to fix it ? 
        (10, 10) 6 => 26
        Which means the both go over. Which needs to fixed. TODO

How to make an ace function ? 
  If adding 11 to original deck makes it exceed 21.
  Make ace 1
  Else keep ace 11
  Issue : 11 is randomly selected.
    Solution : if append is 11 then make the above function.

Issue with over 21 function 
  Whether to create a separate if-else statement 
  OR
  To add to the previous function ? 
    
STAND FUNCTION : 
  Move to computer randomization.
  Strategy  
    Give computer a choice to hit or pass (set randomly)
    Set the same while loop condition on it (> 21 it loses)

Possible restructure with the bust logic
  Basic give 2 cards to each structure.

  1st instance: 
  If < 21 do give hit or break option
    Wait till stand or if goes over 21.
  if human_deck is over 21 
    Revision of previous belief : Players don't go back and forth you only get to play one round.
    Output: You went over. Bust
  If human_deck is under < 21 : 
    Run while loop of computer
    Run until computer stands or exceeds 21.
  if computer > 21: 
     Print"Computer went bust. You lose"
